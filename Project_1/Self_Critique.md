Self-critique:

For the data.html the, "open excel" needs to have text bigger, more consistent with the paragraph, and more pretier. I need to add a .jpg of an baby angel or the face of hello kitty in a bubble text "click my forehead to view the .xslx". Adding an image woiuld've made my page more coquette. I should've made the font more thicker to make it easier to read for the user. I need to make the bullet points more closer to their paragraph. Putting a border around the images would've made the page cutier. On the data.html I shouldve re-adjusted the title "Run descriptive statistics" more align with the paragraph. The title makes the user read the sidebar first than the paragraph, when it should've been another way around. I would put another side bar, but for the navigation throughout the page's titles. A navigation bar for each title of the page so the user can easily click on the title, instead of looking for it throughout the page.
